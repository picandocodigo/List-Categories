# List Categories

Simple plugin to display categories in any post or page with a
shortcode. It's basically a shortcode API interface to the
[wp_list_categories](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_list_categories/)
WordPress function.

Usage:

`[categories orderby=count]`

Will display links to all the categories and order them by number of
posts in each category.
